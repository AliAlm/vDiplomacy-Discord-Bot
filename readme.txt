A vDiplomacy Discord bot that reminds you when you need to submit orders.

It scrapes the game page and determines how much time is left on the turn, and who has already submitted orders or pressed 'ready'

In order for it to work, create a file named .env formatted like this:

DISCORD_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
DISCORD_CHANNEL=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

PLAYER1="Name1"
PLAYER2="Name2"
...
etc.

PLAYER1_ID = '<@XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX>''
PLAYER2_ID = '<@XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX>'
...
etc.

COUNTRY1 = Athens
COUNTRY2 = Byzantium
...
etc.
